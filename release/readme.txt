Description             : This mod replaces many of the cogs in JK in an attempt to to bring
                          the game into the 21st century.  All the weapons and force powers have
                          been rescripted to enhance the playing experience. There is a degree
                          of influence from JO, since there were some nice features there.
                          This mod was designed to work in concert with Shred's JK Enhanced
                          model replacement mod, but it will also work fine with regular JK.
                          Some additional features are available with the use of the JK
                          unofficial patch's new cog verbs. The mod will decide whether to
                          use those features or not based on whether the new verbs are enabled.

                          See Features.doc for details on each addition made to the game.

Additional Credits to   : The JKHub community for their input
                          Hideki, from whom I learned some neat cogging techniques (scope,
                           flash-bang type blinding, etc)
                          Jedi Outcast and Mysteries of the Sith, from which I drew some of
                           the ideas I implemented.

Known Bugs              : One major problem common to many mods is JK crashing when loading a game.
                          There's no way to really "fix" this, but I included a "Safe Save" feature
                          that will autosave the level at a point that will not crash JK when it
                          tries to load.  It functions very similar to JK's quicksave function,
                          except if Safe Save cannot save when you activate it, it will continue
                          to check the game, and will save at the first valid opportunity.  See
                          Features.doc for more details.

                          If you run out of sequencer mines, it won't deselect (this part is
                          deliberate).  If you do manually deselect (this is the "bug") you can't
                          select sequencers again until you have at least 1. This is a JK issue. I
                          could code around it, but it's pretty minor. If the mines didn't have the
                          proximity function and were simply remotely detonated, I would probably
                          fix this, but as is, it's more work than I think it's worth. So for right
                          now, it stays as is.

                          The Repeater Fire 3 won't fire continuously if you release and press the
                          Fire 3 hotkey during the fire delay.  This is because of my setting the
                          bin wait to prevent rapid-firing via tapping the button repeatedly. It's
                          so minor I don't really see any reason to fix it -- It's more work than
                          I think it's worth.
